# CheXpert-Multilabel-Model
Code to create and train a deep learning model to predict multiple (multilabel) abnormalities and diagnoses from 14 different categories. Applied transfer learning with ResNet50 architecture to enhance the performance of my classifier, leveraging pre-trained weights on the CheXpert dataset for improved accuracy in irregularity diagnosis. Also plots loss per epoch to analyze model accuracy during training.
